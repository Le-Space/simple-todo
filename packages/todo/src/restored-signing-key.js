/**
 * A passkey restored on this device brings its OrbitDB signing key with it.
 *
 * `restoreIdentityFromAuthenticator()` reads the passkey's PRF output in its
 * first touch and derives the signing key from it. The provider, left to
 * itself, derives that same key again when OrbitDB asks for the identity — and
 * to do so it asks the passkey for the PRF output once more: a touch that
 * yields nothing new. Put into the keystore first, the key is simply there
 * (`ensureDerivedSigningKey` finds it and leaves it alone), and a restore
 * costs three touches instead of four: two to restore, one to sign the
 * identity.
 *
 * The chapters carry the key on the credential as a non-enumerable property,
 * so no serialiser writes it down: `storeWebAuthnCredential` spreads the
 * credential, and a spread copies only what is enumerable.
